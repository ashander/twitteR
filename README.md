## twitteR
twitteR is an R package which provides access to the Twitter API. Most functionality of the API is supported, with a bias towards API calls that are more useful in data analysis as opposed to daily interaction. 

## Getting Started

- Please read the [user vignette](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/vignettes/twitteR.pdf), which admittedly can get a bit out of date
- I generally recommend that users track this GitHub version as opposed to the CRAN version as releases only happen every few months and many fixes can show up in that time. To do this, simply install the `devtools` package and then you can issue the command `install_github("twitteR", username="geoffjentry")`
- If you have any questions or issues, check out the [mailing list](http://lists.hexdump.org/listinfo.cgi/twitter-users-hexdump.org)
