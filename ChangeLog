   - changed showStatus() to use character based input due to large IDs

     retry limit is reached (even if it was 0) twitteR will now try to return

     (with a warning) 
   - Added function getTwitterOAuth(consumer_key, consumer_secret) which is a 
     wrapper around the ROAuth creation/handshaking process which embeds the

     the OAuth credential so you can save it for future use if you wish.
