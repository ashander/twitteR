2/20/2012 - version 0.99.19:
   - Fixed a bug in lookupUsers where screen names that had upper
     case characters in them weren't being properly populated
   - Switched (temporarily) to rjson in order to properly handle unicode
     text data from Twitter
   - Changed DM sender_id and recipient_id to be using the corresponding
     id_str
