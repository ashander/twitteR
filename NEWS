CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.6 (2013-04-05)
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed a bug in searchTwitter which would fill the tail end of a query
    with duplicated tweets if the user requested more than available
    
    o Changed showStatus to use character based input due to large IDs

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.5 (2013-03-26)
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    - Changed 'blockOnRateLimit' (boolean) to 'retryOnRateLimit' (integer). If
     this value is supplied (to any of the twitteR API wrappers) the system
     will retry up to N times if Twitter's rate limit in effect. If the 
     retry limit is reached (even if it was 0) twitteR will now try to return
     any partial results that had been accumulated prior to the rate limit
     (with a warning)
   - Added function getTwitterOAuth(consumer_key, consumer_secret) which is a 
     wrapper around the ROAuth creation/handshaking process which embeds the
     Twitter URLs. Will also call registerTwitterOAuth for you and then return
     the OAuth credential so you can save it for future use if you wish.
